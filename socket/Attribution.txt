I only recolored some sprites, 
and drew the 'bars' for crafting.
The rest of the credit goes to 
the fabulous community at openGameArt,
specifically the LPC artists.

A big Thank you to the creators of all 
the artwork, spritesheets and
animations. I couldn't have 
made it look 1/10 as good 
in the amount of time
creating this project.
